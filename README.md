# Ambient Light Block

Adds a light block that automatically changes its emitted light level and block/item models based on the time of day.

Works similarly to Minecraft's Light Block. Here is a showcase of a Light Block (left) manually set to level 10, and an Ambient Light Block (right), automatically giving off the same light level the sunrise does.

Here is a showcase of the inventory item model, which also changes dynamically.
